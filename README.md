Daily Realized Volatility Prediction of SP500 Index (SPX)
====================

The main goal of this project is to forecast daily volatility of the SP500 during the period 2016-2023.

#### Requirements:
```
The requirements are inside the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.
```

This project can be sub-divided into these main parts:
1. Download Market Capitalization data from CRSP, sourced from Wharton 
2. Download indicators
3. Sentimental Analysis
4. Models

## Download Data
Data was downloaded from these websites:
* __CRSP__ was used for Market Capitalization of SP500 and the first 50 firms of the index
* __Yahoo Finance__ was used for Indicators
* __Economic Policy Uncertainty__ was used for indicators

## Sentimental Analysis
The sentimental analysis can be divided into these main passages:
1. Scrap all information regarding SP500 from Wikipedia. Subsequently, scrap all news from [Business Market Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/). Everything is done in [scraper.py](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/scraper.py)
2. Run the sentiment on all scraped headlines using [sentimental.py](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/tree/master/Sentiment%20Analysis)
3. Plots and analysis of of data scraped in the parts above in [plots_SP500.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/plots_SP500.ipynb)
4. Analysis sentimental scores in [sentimental_and_plots.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/sentimental_and_plots.ipynb)
5. Computation of extra weight which will be given to the first 50 firms of the SP500. Code is visible in [market_capitalization_weights.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/market_capitalization_weights.ipynb)
6. Adjust sentiment scores taking into account the weights computed previously. Run [compute_weighted_sentiments.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis/compute_weighted_sentiments.ipynb)

Due to GitHub's storage limitations, some CSV files which were used cannot be uploaded. However, they can still be visualized [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W8QDA1jgOxivhFTOHspg3MQxtIqEm2Ha?usp=drive_link).

In order to not encounter any problems with the codes, they have to be saved in a Directory called ```Data```. For instance, the CSV file ```sp500_news_and_sentimental.csv``` must be present in ```Data\sp500_news_and_sentimental.csv```, as well as all the other CSV files.

## Model Implementation
Before running financial econometrics and ML's models, we need to scrap financial data from online and to subsequently merge it with the data from Oxford-Man Instituteâ€™s and TwelveData. All steps can be visualized in [RV dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/RV%20dataset.ipynb). Then, data analysis is computed in [Data Analysis and Visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization.ipynb)

Now, after data analysis was done, we ran the models:
1. Regression models: Linear, Lasso, Ridge. Code can be visualized in [Regression.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/Regression.ipynb).
2. Financial econometrics models (GARCH and VAR), with the testing of all their assumptions. The code can be found in [GARCH_VAR.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/GARCH_VAR.ipynb)
3. Lastly, ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, RNN, LSTM) were executed in [ML models.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/ML%20models.ipynb).

All model results can be observed in [Results.ipynb](https://github.com/hosseinabadi/Realized-Volatility-Prediction/blob/master/Results.ipynb).
